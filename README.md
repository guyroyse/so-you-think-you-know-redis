# So You Think You Know Redis!

This is the repository for my talk *So You Think You Know Redis*. It's a talk where I ask multiple-choice questions about weird Redis corners, give candy to the people who get them correct, and then explain the details.

Herein you will find the [abstract](ABSTRACT.md), [slides](so-you-think-you-know-redis.pdf), and [demo bits](demos) for this talk.
