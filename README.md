# So You Think You Know Redis!

This is the repository for my talk *So You Think You Know Redis*. It's a talk where I ask multiple-choice questions about weird Redis corners, give candy to the people who get them correct, and then explain the details.

Herein you will find the [abstract](ABSTRACT.md) and (eventually) slides for this talk. There isn't any sample code becuase there isn't a demo.
