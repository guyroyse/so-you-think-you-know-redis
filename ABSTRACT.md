# So You Think You Know Redis!

Redis. You love it. You need it. But how well do you really know it? Find out on the exciting new gameshow So You Think You Know Redis! where our host will challenge you to answer a series of questions about Redis. The first person to answer each question correctly wins a ~~crappy American candy bar~~ fancy imported chocolate!

On So You Think You Know Redis! you’ll learn things about Redis you might not know. Crazy things like how to set up circular lists, extract 13-bit integers, or add numbers with sorted sets. Tricky things like cache invalidation, cache eviction, and single-byte caches. Advanced things like persisting your data with Redis and extending Redis with modules.

When we’re all done, you’ll walk away with a deeper knowledge of Redis and possibly that fancy imported chocolate you need. What’s not to love?
